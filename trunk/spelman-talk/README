On 24 September 2008, Alex gave a talk at Spelman College for an algorithms
class. Asked to present on the sort of algorithms used at Google, he opted to
speak briefly about information retrieval.

This was prepared in an off-the-cuff sort of way, from publicly available
materials. Alex doesn't personally work on search, or even know much more
about it than the average programmer with an armchair interest.

This is his sample code, whipped up the evening before and demo'd during the
class period.
