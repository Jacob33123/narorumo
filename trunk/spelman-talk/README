-- Preface to the 2010 code --
In July 2010, Alex was again faced with the possibility of giving a talk to
some kids about information retrieval, so he polished up the code a bit, made
it work with Python 3, and added the ability to actually do queries, which was
previously conspicuously absent.

For an interesting experiment, make sure that tf-idf and lowercasing are turned
on, then search for "page", which you would expect should return the document
about Larry Page. Does that not work? Why not?

Most of the coding was done on the bus from Ithaca to NYC.

-- Preface to the 2008 code --
On 24 September 2008, Alex gave a talk at Spelman College for an algorithms
class. Asked to present on the sort of algorithms used at Google, he opted to
speak briefly about information retrieval.

This was prepared in an off-the-cuff sort of way, from publicly available
materials. Alex doesn't personally work on search, or even know much more
about it than the average programmer with an armchair interest.

This is his sample code, whipped up the evening before and demo'd during the
class period.
