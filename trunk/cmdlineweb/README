This is where Alex is working on tools to do web-type things from the command
line.

So far, he's got a program to print out today's agenda (agenda.py) from Google
Calendar.

Next up are programs to print out his current gmail inbox and show URLs and
snippets for the Google hits for a particular query.

agenda.py requires the Python gdata api, which is available here:
http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/ . It was developed with version
2.0.6, but will probably work with later ones.
