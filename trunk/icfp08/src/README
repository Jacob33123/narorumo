Our rover has two modes, GO-HOME and EVADE [1], which are implemented as a
stack, CURRENT-STRATEGY. The GO-HOME mode is always the bottom-most item on
the stack. On each iteration through our main loop, the ANYTHING-WORRYING?
predicate examines each of the objects in our view and lets us know if we
should be concerned about any of them. It not, we happily continue toward the
center of the map; if so, we evade the bad stuff using an extremely
sophisticated pathfinding algorithm known as "accelerate and turn left". [2]

As if there were any way in which our rover-controlling software could
possibly be improved, we've also begun to implement a system for storing map
data, so that later runs in a trial can benefit from information gathered
during earlier runs. Implementation of the remaining parts of this system are
left as an exercise for the reader.

[2] We also find this strategy to be eminently useful at track meets, unless
we're participating in the 100-meter dash or pole vault events.
