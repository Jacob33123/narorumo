April 2008, I tried rewriting my old sudoku solver to work with Google App
Engine. And it worked, except it was really slow and might have a subtle bug in
it (it runs way too long on underspecified problems), but naive backtracking
search is a little boring anyway, and I want to have two versions now, one that
does DLX (which is amazingly fast, I saw somebody else's version just chew
through supposedly "hard" problems), and one that does randomized
hill-climbing, for comparison. Simulated Annealing FTW.

** from the 2006 README
It solves sudoku puzzles :)

There are some hardcoded paths, which is gross (sorry) -- I'm not
super-familiar with python or mod_python yet. But if it doesn't work,
change the chunks of code where it's changing the pythonpath at the top of
sudoku.py and web_sudoku.py.

To run from the commandline, go ./main.py <filename>

Enjoy!
