It solves sudoku puzzles :)

There are some hardcoded paths, which is gross (sorry) -- I'm not
super-familiar with python or mod_python yet. But if it doesn't work,
change the chunks of code where it's changing the pythonpath at the top of
sudoku.py and web_sudoku.py.

To run from the commandline, go ./main.py <filename>

Enjoy!
