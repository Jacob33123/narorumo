When the analyzer starts, it displays the message "Starting
emufuzzer_analyser XMLRPC server on port 55555".  It then sits in a
tight loop, waiting for the emulator module to pass it some
information: a machine state and an instruction to execute.  [TODO:
Where in the code does this happen?]

EmuFuzzer starts by both write-protecting and read-protecting all
pages of memory on the real machine.  [TODO: Where in the code does
this happen?]  The emulator sends over instructions, one at a time, to
be run on the real machine.  When an instruction tries to read memory,
we intercept the access via the page fault and go and get the page
from the emulated environment (so we "lazily" grab pages from the
emulated environment as needed).  Then we have the page in the
physical environment, readable but still not writable.
