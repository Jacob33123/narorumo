_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Breaks down a numeric element of a data frame by one or more
     categorical elements and displays the breakdown as a plot.

_U_s_a_g_e:

      x=NULL,xinfo=NULL,space=0.1,xlim=NULL,ylim=NULL,main="",xlab="",ylab="",

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

 formula: A formula with a numeric element of a data frame on the left
          and one or more categorical elements on the right.

    data: A data frame containing the elements in 'formula'.

maxlevels: The maximum number of levels in any categorical element.
          Mainly to prevent the mess caused by breaking down by a huge
          number of categories.

num.desc: The summary functions to use. The defaults are usually
          appropriate, but the user can pass other summary functions if
          desired.

       x: This becomes the result of the breakdown after the first
          call. Currently anything passed as this argument will be
          ignored.

   xinfo: The result of 'brkdnCrawler' to be passed to recursive calls.
          As with 'x', anything passed as this argument will be
          ignored.

   space: The amount of space to leave at each side of the bar as a
          proportion of the bar width.

xlim,ylim: Optional x and y limits for the plot.

    main: Title for the plot.

xlab,ylab: Axis labels for the plot.

 errbars: Whether to display error bars on the lowest level of
          breakdown.

     col: The colors to use to fill the bars. See Details.

  lineht: The height of a line of text in the lower margin of the plot
          in user units. This will be calculated by the function if a
          value is not passed.

 showall: Whether to display bars for the entire breakdown.

showbrklab: Whether to display the labels for the lowest level of
          breakdown.

firstcall: This is used to keep track of recursive calls. Don't change
          it.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     'hierobarp' displays a bar plot illustrating the breakdown of a
     numeric element of a data frame by one or more categorical
     elements. The breakdown is performed by 'brkdn.num'. Typically,
     the mean of each category specified by the formula is displayed as
     the height of a bar. If 'showall' is TRUE, the entire nested
     breakdown will be displayed. This can be useful in visualizing the
     relationship between groups and subgroups in a compact format.

     If there are more than three functions named in 'num.desc' and
     'errbars' is TRUE, 'hierobarp' will assume that the second and
     third functions define the upper and lower confidence limits of
     the estimate and display appropriate error bars. This allows the
     user to define asymmetric confidence limits using quantiles.

     The colors of the bars are determined by 'col'. If 'showall' is
     FALSE, the user only need pass a vector of colors, usually the
     same length as the number of categories in the final (first on the
     right side) element in the formula. If 'showall' is TRUE and the
     user wants to color all of the bars, a list with as many elements
     as there are levels in the breakdown should be passed. Each
     element should be a vector of colors, again usually the same
     length as the number of categories.
