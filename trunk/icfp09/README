This is our entry for the 2009 ICFP Programming Contest!  

Our solution uses the following language implementations:

  * Petite Chez Scheme 7.4
  * Python 2.6.1
  * R version 2.9.1 (2009-06-26)

To build a solution for, e.g., Hohmann scenario 1001, run Petite Chez
Scheme from the 'icfp09' directory and execute the following:

(load "hohmann.scm") 
(controller 1001)

Doing so will generate a file called "hohmann.trace" in the 'scratch'
directory.  (If R does its job, it will also generate a nice PDF
visualization of the scenario.) 

To build an .osf from hohmann.trace, exit to the shell and run

./pack-osf.py 1001 scratch/hohmann.trace 1001.osf

from the icfp09 directory.

Likewise, to build solutions for Meet and Greet scenarios, just
replace "hohmann" with "meetandgreet" in the above instructions.

Credit where credit's due: our solutions make use of Oleg Kiselyov's
'pmatch' pattern-matching macro for Scheme, available at
http://www.cs.indiana.edu/classes/c311/pmatch.scm (and also in the
'lib' directory of this tarball).  Also, our visualizations use the
free 'plotrix' library for R.

Thanks for reading our README!
