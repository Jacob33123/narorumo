The TODO pile grows down.

- extract a grammar for ucblogo from somewhere (possibly another logo
  implementation?)
  It may be that logo syntax doesn't yield to being expressed with a cfg very
  easily. In that case, what are we going to do?

- sensibly process the parse tree from the logo

- understand parsec well enough to add cases that sensibly accept:

to square :size
  fd :size rt 90
  fd :size rt 90
  fd :size rt 90
  fd :size rt 90
end

DONE:
- be able to create a parser, open up a file, and run the parser on that file.
  (only -- the parser that we create is for Appel's Tiger language, from the
  compilers book.)
