(Empathize with them
Cut your finger on SPAM top
Pigs must feel that too
Stomach full of SPAM
Swimming is prohibited
Rocks sink in water
I envision a
world where all mankind shares SPAM
and none go without.
Frugal SPAM repast
to quiet growling stomach
Damn this poverty
Dwindling SPAM stockpile
leftovers from better times
Wolf is at the door
Cardboard box living
SPAM-grease fire to warm my hands
can edge for razor
When good times return
with God as my witness
not eat SPAM again

Spilling the leftovers of creational clay
We grew with the concept now we are ready to go public
Today is a big day for the company
A big step for the little steppers who slept for years uncomfortably
Little man little lady cute little baby
Reach your hand out to the future of automated robotics
On display here for the first time in enter year here
At the worlds fair but is it really

Hat shoes purse and gloves
SPAM a lovely complement
All will envy you

She ran to the ledge
Tears welled up in her blue eyes
The SPAM was all gone

I eat my SPAM with
pickles It helps bear the
taste of dank pig guts

SPAM The ideal meat
For cheap paintball excitement
and fun at parties

spiced ham in can yum
spiced ham given unto
eaten vomited

SPAM sliding down throat
Care not its composition
Greasy good in gut

Pale pink delicious
Fills every nook and cranny
Hot mail mouth Both full

settling in from the Mexican adventure and trying to get a grasp
around the work we have ahead of us

who has written on apocalyptic literature

in retrospect I think was just a sick asolescent fantasy

She started crying

Do you like beer

Yesterday everybody had to dress up and be in tip top

another any

as I conceive it Zen is the ultimate fact of all philosophy and religion

every intellectual effort must culminate in it

feeling or mere faith is so blind and will grasp anything that may come
across and hold to it as the final reality

fanaticism is vital enough as far as its explosiveness is concerned
but this is not a true religion and its practical sequence is the
destruction of the whole system

I should be sorry to believe it too
one would think that the heart alone would be worn out with tears
she was already quite drunk
covered with bruises

I was thinking about my sick friend
Stringing a ring around my wits end
Motley day goblins brought up pillage to pass the stillness
With bad javelin tip dipped inside barrel black magic brilliance
Who rose at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier
To capture the fashion fragment choreographed in traffic dancing for nickels
Looked like sickle cells with the principles of high rotary
One hope distortion odyssey sputters itself to my how not example sample
Give me the bread crust while considering the littering
I do not pity the head rush or the whimpering spill
Anchor to rock bottom rocks bottom packs a ravenous catalyst
Sprung arachnid leashed by the carnal tyrant
I choked when the cage bird sings and stings
Springs me up delirium to stitch the clipped wings


And I thought that it was easy for me to select some matters which should
neither be obnoxious to much controversy nor should compel me to expound
more of my principles than I desired
and which should yet be sufficient
clearly to exhibit what I can or cannot accomplish in the sciences


To this end Common Lisp assumes that files are named that given a name one
can construct a stream connected to a file of that name and that the names
can be fit into a certain canonical implementation independent form called
a path name
Facilities are provided for manipulating pathnames for creating streams
connected to files and for manipulating the file system through path names
and streams

From Clee to heaven the beacon burns
    The shires have seen it plain
From north and south the sign returns 
    And beacons burn again

Look left look right the hills are bright
    The dales are light between
Because  fifty years tonight 
    That God has saved the Queen
 
Now when the flame they watch not towers
    About the soil they trod
Lads we will remember friends of ours
    Who shared the work with God
 
To skies that knit their heartstrings right
    To fields that bred them brave
The saviours come not home to-night
    Themselves they could no save
 
It dawns in Asia tombstones show
    And Shropshire names are read
And the Nile spills his overflow
    Beside the severn dead
 
We pledge in peace by farm and town
    The Queen they served in war
And fire the beacons up and down 
    The land they perished for
 
God save the Queen we living sing
    From height to height tis heard
And with the rest your voices ring
    Lads of the Fifty-third
 
Oh God will save her fear you not
    Be you the men you've been
Get you the sons your fathers got
    And God will save the Queen

Loveliest of trees the cherry now
Is hung with bloom along the bough
And stands about the woodland ride
Wearing white for Easter tide
 
Now of my threescore years and ten
Twenty will not come again
And take from seventy springs a score
It only leaves me fifty more
 
And since to look at things in bloom
Fifty springs are little room
About the woodlands I will go 
To see the cherry hung with snow
