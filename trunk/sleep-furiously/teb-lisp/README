TEB: Trurl's Electronic Bard
Alex Rudnick (alexr@cc.gatech.edu)
cs7613 project, fall 2005

** compatability
TEB has been tested with SBCL, clisp, and Allegro, so it will almost
certainly work on your lisp system :)

sbcl seems to run it the fastest, though.

** sources
- The directory ltre/ contains the ltre/ltms system developed by Forbus and
  de Kleer, tweaked very slightly for compatability.

- The rhyme calculation system (which lives in "rhymes.lisp" was
  implemented by me, but is an implementation of an algorithm developed for
  Bradley Buda's excellent rhyme calculation system, outlined at
  http://www.bradleybuda.com/rhymes

- Dictionaries used include the Moby Project's part-of-speech dictionary
  (in "moby-pos.sexprs") and the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary. These are
  available at http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict and
  http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/research/ilash/Moby/ respectively. I did some
  tweaking on both of these for ease-of-use, compatability (removal of
  weird characters, for example), and completeness.
  
  If you find yourself with a copy of mobyposi.i, you can produce something
  like moby-pos.sexprs by running it through moby-process.c.

- TEB has been fed from a variety of sources, including: 
  - The Spam-Ku Archive: http://mit.edu/jync/www/spam/
  - Lyrics from rappers El-P and Aesop Rock (both on Definitive Jux Records,
    with transcriptions from the Original Hip-Hop Lyrics Archive, ohhla.com)
  - An assortment of posts culled from livejournal.com
  - _Zen Buddhism_ -- the writings of D.T. Suzuki, edited by William Barrett.
  - Fyodor Dostoevsky's "Notes From The Underground"
  - Rene Descartes' _Discourse on Method_
  - Guy L. Steele's _Common Lisp the Language_, second edition.
  - A.E. Housman's _A Shropshire Lad_
