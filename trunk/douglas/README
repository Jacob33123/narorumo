"Say something normal, like... Douglas."

Douglas is where I'll implement a really, really simple phrase-based
statistical MT system. For practice!

Components include:
- IBM model 1, for word alignments
- phrase extraction and phrase-table building
- a monotone phrase-based decoder

This will not win any competitions. But it's good weights to lift!

Douglas is in Python 3; the next version will be in C++ and called Ramsey.
