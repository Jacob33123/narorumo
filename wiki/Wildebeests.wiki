#summary The narorumo compendium of useful wildebeest-related information

= Spelling =
It's spelled unusually for a word in English because it originates from Dutch/Afrikaans -- although apparently "beest" means more like "cattle" than "beast". Interestingly, Dutch has not picked up this word, despite how awesome it is. What would they use to describe such an animal?

= Gnu =
It's the same animal. The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khoikhoi Khoikhoi]-speaking people from southern Africa apparently pronounce the "g" at the beginning.
