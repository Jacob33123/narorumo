= One =
Let Σ be a finite alphabet. Prove that Σ∗ is a countable set.

= Two =
Let δ be the transition function of a deterministic finite-state automaton M = (Q, Σ, δ, q0 , F ): δ : Q × Σ → Q.

Consider the extension δ-hat : Q × Σ∗ → Q, of δ, defined by δ-hat(q, epsilon) = q, for a ∈ Σ. δ-hat(q, aw) = δ-hat(δ(q, a), w).
  * Prove that δ(q, a) = δ(q, a) for all q ∈ Q, a ∈ Σ.
  * Prove by induction on strings that for each pair of strings x, y ∈ Σ∗ and state q ∈ Q, δ-hat(q, xy) = δ-hat(δ-hat(q, x), y).

= Three =
Let Σ be an alphabet. For a ∈ Σ, let #a : Σ∗ → N be the function that gives the number of times the character a occurs in the input string.
  * Prove that L = {w ∈ {a, b}∗ | #a (w) = #b (w)} is not regular.
  * Show that L is context-free. (You need not prove that your construction yields L.)

= Four =
  * Show that the class of context-free languages is closed under set union.
  * Show that the class of context-free languages is not closed under set intersection.
