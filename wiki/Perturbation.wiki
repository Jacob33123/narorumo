Today I issued a [http://lindseykuper.livejournal.com/265703.html challenge] to my friends:

 A _perturbation_ of a string is a permutation, but with one `m` removed and one `r` and one `b` added. For example, `perturbation` is a perturbation of `permutation`.

 _*Challenge!*_: I'll bake cookies for the first person who can generate a list of all the words in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_(Unix) your words file] that have at least one valid perturbation. (In this case, a "valid perturbation" is one that also appears in `words`. Perturbation is undefined for strings that don't have an `m` to begin with.)

My friends [http://lindseykuper.livejournal.com/265703.html#comments rose to the challenge], of course ([http://www.jes5199.com Jesse Wolfe] was first with his Ruby implementation; [http://soy.dyndns.org/~peter/ Peter Boothe] did it in Python).  Here's [http://code.google.com/p/narorumo/source/browse/trunk/perturbation/perturbation.pl my version in Perl].

From [Alex], we've got [http://code.google.com/p/narorumo/source/browse/trunk/perturbation/perturbation.py another Python version] and a [http://code.google.com/p/narorumo/source/browse/trunk/perturbation/perturbation.scm Scheme version], both with a little performance optimization ("dumb hack" -- [Alex]) that clever folks should be able to spot.
