#summary Perturbed permutation!
#labels Perl,Perturbation,Permutation

[Lindsey Lindsey Kuper]

Today I issued a [http://lindseykuper.livejournal.com/265703.html challenge] to my friends:

 A _perturbation_ of a string is a permutation, but with one `m` removed and one `r` and one `b` added. For example, `perturbation` is a perturbation of `permutation`.

 _*Challenge!*_: I'll bake cookies for the first person who can generate a list of all the words in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_(Unix) your words file] that have at least one valid perturbation. (In this case, a "valid perturbation" is one that also appears in `words`. Perturbation is undefined for strings that don't have an `m` to begin with.)

My friends [http://lindseykuper.livejournal.com/265703.html#comments rose to the challenge], of course ([http://www.jes5199.com Jesse Wolfe] was first with his Ruby implementation; [http://soy.dyndns.org/~peter/ Peter Boothe] did it in Python).  Here's my version in Perl:

{{{
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;

open WORDS, "/usr/share/dict/words" or die $!;

open PERTURBATIONS, "> perturbations.txt";

my @orig_words;
my %sorted_to_unsorted; # a hash of arrayrefs

my $num_words_with_perturbations = 0;
my $total_perturbations = 0;

foreach my $word (<WORDS>) {
	chomp $word;
	push @orig_words, $word;
	
	my $sorted_word = join( '', sort( split( //, $word )));
	
	if (! $sorted_to_unsorted{$sorted_word}) {
		$sorted_to_unsorted{$sorted_word} = [];
	}
	
	push @{ $sorted_to_unsorted{$sorted_word} }, $word;
}

foreach my $word (@orig_words) {
	chomp $word;
		
	next if $word !~ /m/;
	
	my $rb_word = $word;
	$rb_word =~ s/m//;
	$rb_word = $rb_word . 'rb';

	my $sorted_rb_word = join( '', sort( split( //, $rb_word )));
	
	if ( $sorted_to_unsorted{$sorted_rb_word} > 0 ) {
			$num_words_with_perturbations++;
			
			print PERTURBATIONS "$word perturbs to:\n";
			foreach my $perturbation ( @{ $sorted_to_unsorted{$sorted_rb_word} }) {
				$total_perturbations++;
				print PERTURBATIONS "\t$perturbation\n";
			}
			print "\n";
	}
}

print "$num_words_with_perturbations words have perturbations.  ";
print "There are $total_perturbations perturbations in all.\n";
