A doctor's office consists of a waiting room with n chairs and the
examination room containing the examination table.  If there are no
customers to be served, the doctor goes to sleep.  If a patient enters
the doctor's office and all waiting room chairs are occupied, then the
patient leaves the office.  If the doctor is busy but chairs are
available, then the patient sits in one of the free chairs.  If the
doctor is asleep, the patient wakes up the doctor.  Write an algorithm
that uses either POSIX threads or semaphores to coordinate the doctor
and the patients.
