#summary corpus of the remixable text from Machine of Death

= Most of the stories in _Machine of Death_ allow derivative works =

And when I hear "derivative works", I think the word "remix". But what's a remix of a text? Cut-up poetry? n-gram models to generate ominous-sounding emails to your family? Counting how many times the word "of" appears? This is for you to decide.

Just note that since the stories contained in this corpus are Creative Commons (Attribution, Noncommercial, Sharealike), so is the corpus itself, and your derivative works.
