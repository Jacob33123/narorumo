=The Millionth Fibonacci Number=

[http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-11.html#%_thm_1.19 Exercise 1.19] in _[http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/ SICP]_ is about finding a procedure for calculating Fibonacci numbers that runs in logarithmic time.  They give you most of the algorithm, and the exercise is to come up with a small part of it yourself.

I just finished doing the exercise and used it to calculate the millionth Fibonacci number.  To make sure I had it right, I googled [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22millionth+fibonacci+number%22 "millionth fibonacci number"].  Mine turns out to match what [http://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/~bethenco/fibo/ this person found].

It looks like it made [http://digg.com/odd_stuff/The_millionth_fibonacci_number/who Digg] about a year and a half ago: "This must have taken a while to calculate."  I spent probably about two hours doing math (Alex was the one who pointed out that I had a system of equations which I could use to solve for _p'_ and _q'_, plus I [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RubberDucking rubber-ducked] him a lot^1^), and once the math was done, five minutes writing code.  Actually running the thing took eight seconds or so on my laptop.

Today, Google shows 28 results for [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22millionth+fibonacci+number%22 "millionth fibonacci number"] and 13 results for [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22ten+millionth+fibonacci+number%22 "ten millionth fibonacci number"].  There doesn't seem to be anything for [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22hundred+millionth+fibonacci+number%22 "hundred millionth fibonacci number"].  I wonder how long that would take.
