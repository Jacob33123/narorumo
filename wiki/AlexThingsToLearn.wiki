#summary Alex knows very few things. Here are some that he'd like to learn

So many things to learn. Here are a few things I'd like to know more about. I'll put some notes about them here, and eventually new articles may spin off.

== natural language processing ==
Read all the books on your shelf!
PROGRESS: now pretty comfortable with NLTK.
PROGRESS: Can typically read random NLP research papers!

== maths ==
Linear Algebra.
Get a good intuition for matrices, matrix operations for geometry, and using them to represent high-dimensional spaces.

Stats. Be able to explain frequentist and bayesian ideas about probability.

== databases ==
What kinds are there? How do they work? What makes them faster or slower? How are they indexed? What more can I learn about the SQL language?

== networking ==
What is the OSI model? Maybe learn more about routing? How does DNS work?   

== programming ==
Also: learn idiomatic and deep Scheme, Python, JavaScript, Haskell.
PROGRESS: Writing fairly Pythonic Python, these days? Could always get better.

Learn deep type-system things about Java and the innards of the JVM. Be able to explain "erasures".
Erasure in Java is when the parametrized type in the Java becomes a non-parametrized type in the JVM bytecode. Which is all the time. The JVM bytecode is indeed typed, but it doesn't make use of the parametrized types at runtime.
