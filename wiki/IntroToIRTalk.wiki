#summary intro to information retrieval

This is the notes towards a talk to be given for Spelman College's CIS313, 24 September 2008.

My source material here is the excellent  Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig's
_Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach_. (http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)

Or wikipedia articles, which I'll list here too.

== What's Information Retrieval? ==

How do we define the task?

How do you store/represent your copy of the corpus? What information do you
want to extract about your documents?

Logical connectives and your query language

What are some approaches you might take?

What makes it hard? How can you make it fast?

Polysemy, synonyms, clustering topics...

Parallelism?

Russell and Norvig say:
  After reading the previous chapter, one might suppose that an information
  retrieval system could be built by parsing the document collection into a
  knowledge base of logical sentences and then parsing each query and `ASK`ing
  the knowledge base for answers. Unfortunately, no one has ever succeeded in
  building a large-scale IR system that way. It is just too difficult to build
  a lexicon and grammar that cover a large document collection, so all IR
  systems use simpler language models.
